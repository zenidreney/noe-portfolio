                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p itemprop="about">
                    Noémie Beauvais is an atypical musician who has developed her artistic and educational
                    projects throughout Spain, France and Switzerland.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Originally from La Chartreuse, her love of music led her to study all over the world,
                    always searching for new sounds specific to her instrument, the guitar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spain and Argentina were the two countries that played a key role in her musical discoveries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2008, she was awarded the gold medal in classical guitar at the Nantes Conservatory.
                    Her work then divided between educational projects and artistic productions.
                    She taught herself a second instrument, the chromatic accordion, perfect for adding
                    spice to her musical performances.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She performed in duos with internationally renowned guitarists such as Jacques Marmoud,
                    Diego Trosman, Nono García and Andrea Arnold.
                </p>

                <h2>Artistic Collaborations</h2>

                <p>
                    Over the years, her desire to forge links between music and other art forms took shape
                    through various collaborations with dance, theatre, poetry and photography.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Music Therapy & Well-Being</h2>

                <p>
                    Music therapy became a great source of inspiration and sharing in the fields of disability,
                    retirement homes and hospitals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her aspiration for medicinal music is also reflected in her involvement in mindfulness
                    events, meditation and yoga classes.
                </p>

                <h2>Musical Universe</h2>

                <p>
                    These rich experiences have given rise to a performer, composer and improviser offering
                    a unique genre adaptable to a wide variety of contexts: concert halls, therapeutic workshops,
                    romantic dinners, cinema, dance, weddings and theatre.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Her music can be described as dreamlike, calm and relaxing, yet playful and deeply
                    connected to human beings and nature, her main sources of inspiration.
                </p>

                <h2>Influences</h2>

                <p>
                    Her influences include the mathematical genius of Bach, the universality of Erik Satie,
                    the melancholy of chorihnos, and the passion of tango and flamenco.
                    She also draws inspiration from bossa nova, the socially engaged poetry of Atahualpa
                    Yupanqui, the cadence of the Beatles, the depth of Leonard Cohen,
                    and the great voices of French chanson.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These influences colour and punctuate her guitar playing with unique sounds.
                    Her eclectic music, shaped by the sun, the earth and her travels, reflects her love
                    of nature and art. Both complex and simple, it evokes wild meadows, ocean depths and
                    snow-capped Alps—a hymn to Beauty and Freedom that leaves no one indifferent.
